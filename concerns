security:
    - ip authorization
        - ip spoofing can be implemented to fabricate POST requests that are not welcome
        - if two people are in the same location and try to modify the resource together, no bueno
        (easiest spoofing tactic is to be in the same place as the band member)

    - after 1 day, if the attacker contains information about the previous ciphers sent for authentication,
    they can just authorize as band personnel

front end:
    - the forms in the cms have to be aligned properly
    - the bio output has to have the '+' removed
    - multiple forms input will result in a disaster?
